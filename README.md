# Construction Contract Network

Construction Contract Network contains the business network model and logic for Hyperledger Composer that automates construction contracts and processes where pre-deposits funds for each stage of the construction are locked into the agreement in advance and released as soon as work is performed or materials from supplier are delivered. 

The data model (.cto) defines the assets, participants, transactions, and relationships that form the Business Network.

The business logic (.js) consists of Javascript functions that are invoked automatically by Hyperledger Composer runtime chain code when transactions are submitted for processing.
